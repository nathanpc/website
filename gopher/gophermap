Nathan's personal corner of the internet, fully compatible with
everything, filled with useless information, served to you in glorious
plain text!

i--- About me ---------------------------------------------------------	header null 0

I'm a full-stack developer, creative technologist, and an electronics
engineer born in rainy Brazil and currently living in sunny Portugal.
You can find me working on almost anything that involves electricity,
both in terms of hardware and software.  Building things has always
been a passion of mine, so you'll notice that I'm always self-
motivated to work on new projects that involve technology. Some of the
things that I've worked on have been used by hundreds of thousands of
people, maybe into the millions depending on who's counting, and my
work has definitely reached at least tens of millions.

I'm currently dedicating some of my time to passing some of my
knowledge to another generation and having a lot of fun working on
creative projects with my students and colleagues at IADE - Creative
University, where I'm the course coordinator of the bachelor's in
Computer Engineering, but I'm also involved with the bachelor's in
Creative Technologies, Games Development, and the master's in Creative
Computing and Artificial Intelligence.

If you browse through my personal gopherhole and website, or my
company's website, you'll notice that I'm capable of building quite a
lot of amazing things. If you're looking for someone with my skillset
either for your company or to make your idea become a reality feel
free to reach out to me.

i--- Phlog ------------------------------------------------------------	header null 0

If you are interested in following what I'm currently working on, or
my constant stream of thought, I have recently (2025) started a phlog
in glorious plain text, that is then mirrored as a blog on my website.

goes all the way back to 2011 on my website:

i--- Old Computer Challenge -------------------------------------------	header null 0

By far the best time of year for any retro computer enthusiast or
anyone that's fed up with the current state of technology is OCC week,
when the community gets together to spend the week immersed in old
technology and having a blast!

i--- Hanging out ------------------------------------------------------	header null 0

I may be inviting weirdos into my life, but if you're ever around
Lisbon, contact me and we can probably arrange to hang out somewhere
and awkwardly talk about technology.

If you prefer to hang out with me, and other like-minded people that
love plain text and older technology without the awkwardness of being
physically in the same room, you can find me hanging out (mostly on
weekends) at
h#oldcomputerchallenge on Libera.Chat's IRC server	URL:https://web.libera.chat/gamja/#oldcomputerchallenge

i--- More from me on the web ------------------------------------------	header null 0

Although I love the simplicity of Gopher, I do have a much larger
presence on the web, although differently from almost everyone I still
make all my websites available through plain HTTP and ensure that they
are as compatible with older browsers as possible.
