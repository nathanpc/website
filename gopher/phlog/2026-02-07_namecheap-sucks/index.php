<pre id="plain-text">I've been a happy customer of Namecheap since July 13th 2011, when I registered
the domain name dreamintech.net to create a technology news site with a couple
of IRC friends from the #dreamincode channel.

Back then I only knew about GoDaddy and LocaWeb (the defacto registrar and
hosting company in Brazil), but my friends told me that this Namecheap registrar
was the best. I won't lie, because of its name, I was a bit hesitant, but I
registered with them anyway, since people on IRC never lie right?

They were right, and I was pretty happy with their service during the last 14
years. It's the only domain registrar I had ever used, and I felt very good when
the whole GoDaddy backing the Stop Online Piracy Act controversy [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_surrounding_GoDaddy#Backing_of_SOPA_and_resultant_boycott">1</a>] was
happening and Namecheap was heralded online as the best registrar to move to.

During almost 15 years I registered well over 20 domains with them, and
recommended them to anyone that ever talked to me about getting a domain, I was
an extremely loyal customer and championed their platform whenever possible.
Their names were cheap, and even though their website was painful to use, it
provided the service I wanted for good price and nothing more.

Fastforward to January of this year 2026, and I get an email talking about price
increases on some of my domains. I always ignored these, since I know that from
time to time, the prices do go up, it's normal, but this time I noticed two
things regarding a .eu domain that I own:

  - The registration price went up 2 USD (from $6.98 to $8.98)
  - The renewal price went up 1.50 USD (from $9.48 to $10.98)

A 2 US dollar increase felt way more substantial than the regular increase over
the years due to ICANN fees or simple registry fees going up. Also I noticed
that the renewal price was different than the registration one. I always thought
they were the same, apart from new domain deals registrars usually use to trick
people into buying expensive domains.

Because of these discrepancies I decided to look at the prices of similar
domains with other registrars, and to my surprise, they were a lot cheaper, like
$5 cheaper. This made me very furious, Namecheap was no longer cheap...

I started searching for what happened, and apparently Namecheap started getting
a pretty bad reputation when I wasn't looking [<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NameCheap/comments/1nbx5ie/renewals_pricing_is_out_of_control/">2</a>][<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NameCheap/comments/yhhrzy/renewal_price_going_up_over_1200/">3</a>].

I asked some friends IRL for suggestions on the current best registrar and they
all recommended either CloudFlare or Porkbun. Searching Reddit and their
recommendations line up with comments online. Since I wasn't looking forward to
dealing directly with CloudFlare, given I don't like them very much, and their
registrar is a loss-leader [<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/19a1fsc/choosing_cloudflare_as_my_domain_registrar/kiib5vi/">4</a>], I decided to register with Porkbun, which still
uses CloudFlare [<a href="https://porkbun.com/products/dns_management">5</a>], but I was willing to cope with this.

Registering with Porkbun wasn't very pleasant since I had to perform the dreaded
online ID verification process [<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/06/hack-age-verification-company-shows-privacy-danger-social-media-laws">6</a>], which I'm fully against. This step almost
made me ditch Porkbun, but I guess money and good customer service is a priority
right now and I'm still conflicted about consenting to the whole process.

I have currently moved 2 of my domains, including this one (nathancampos.me) to
Porkbun without any issues, and I plan to move completely away from Namecheap as
my domains near their expiry date this year.

<h3>Moving away from Namecheap with ease
------------------------------------</h3>

As a side note I would like to document the process of quickly moving away from
Namecheap and not having any down time.

The first step you should take is to get a zone file from Namecheap. This can be
done by bypassing their AI support chatbot and asking a human to retrieve it for
you or you can also do it by visiting the following URL while logged in to your
Namecheap account [<a href="https://ap.www.namecheap.com/Domains/dns/GetAdvancedDnsInfo?fillTransferInfo=false&domainName=YOURDOMAINNAME.tld">7</a>] and downloading a JSON file with all your DNS information.

The downloaded JSON file can then be passed through this Python script provided
by GitHub user ashleykleynhans [<a href="https://gist.github.com/ashleykleynhans/69e4fb525d4f32d766313d3f9d22b688">8</a>]:

After exporting the zone file you can follow Porkbun's tutorial on how to
transfer a domain with minimal downtime [<a href="https://kb.porkbun.com/article/89-how-to-transfer-a-domain-to-porkbun-with-no-downtime">9</a>] and don't forget to speed up the
process by approving the transfer [<a href="https://kb.porkbun.com/article/88-how-to-transfer-a-domain-from-namecheap-to-porkbun#expedite-transfer">10</a>] as soon as you get the email from
Namecheap.

This are the steps that I followed to transfer my domains, so I hope it helps
you do the same. Fuck Namecheap.
