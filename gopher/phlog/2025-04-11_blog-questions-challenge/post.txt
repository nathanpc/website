Blog Questions Challenge: Technology Edition
============================================

I was challenged by zero_cool [1] (aka Headcrash) to write this blog post. This
is part of a series of posts from some of the most interesting people currently
on the internet, so you should definitely go back through the links in each of
the blogs involved in the challenge, you will most likely find more people that
enjoy the same hobbies as you.

Before we begin I would like to appologize for everyone in the challenge because
I've probably been holding it up for more than a month. Right after zero_cool
challenged me a ton of work and life stuff happened that really made it
difficult for me to write anything, so I hope we can kick this off once again.


When did you first get interested in technology?
------------------------------------------------

To be perfectly honest can't remember a time when I haven't been interested in
technology. Some of my first memories are of me playing with the family
computer, being fascinated by television, and breaking things apart to look
inside. Judging by the home movies my parents made, even before I can remember,
I was already fascinated by machines (tractors, cars, etc.), power tools, and
circuit boards, or "electrical cities" as I have been recorded saying in one of
the family's tapes.

I have vivid memories of playing with (most likely completely trashing) the
family's Windows 95 computer when I was 4, even though I didn't know how to read
yet, I clicked things, watched what happened, and memorized the icons. I was
able to open games, shutdown the computer, an play many hours of thrilling games
such as Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint, Minesweeper, and Treasure
MathStorm! [2], which to this day I still don't know how it ended up in that
computer. I had no clue what I was doing, but I was happy enough that I could
play with such amazing technology.

My interest in technology during my early childhood was mostly around using
computers and tearing down every piece of electronics equipment that was gifted
to me (didn't matter if it was working or not before I opened it). It was joke
amongst my family that, if you gave me an RC car, I would simply remove the
motors and have more fun attaching batteries to them than actually driving it
around, as happened many times.

When I got into my early teenage years I got fascinated with mobile computing,
something that to this day still fascinates me, and for a very long time,
probably until my 20s, all I lusted after were Palms. Pocket PCs and smartphones
such as Nokias, WM-era HTCs, and eventually Android and iOS when those came out.

Eventually, when I was about 17 a new interest in technology was found when I
decided I wanted an Arduino kit for Christmas. After playing around with
electronics I never stopped, computers became boring, and this interest led me
to pursue a carrier in electronics design, shaping most of my adult life.

After this reflection, I can safely say that my early interest in technology is
what has basically shaped my entire life.


What's your favourite piece of technology all-time?
---------------------------------------------------

This is a tricky one, since technology has always been such an integral part of
my life, it's very difficult to pinpoint a specific piece of technology that I
can call a favorite one. There has simply been way to many favorites along my
life.

Although, after some careful consideration I would say that definitely the piece
of technology that has been with me for the longest time, and that has shaped
many of my decisions, is always in the back of my head, and that I try to insert
into as many contexts of my life as possible, has been and will always be the HP
Jornada 720 [3].

This little Handheld PC has been a love of mine ever since I got one used on
MercadoLivre (eBay of Brazil) back in 2006. It's what I still believe a pocket
computer should be in terms of size and ergonomics. It's an amazing piece of
technology and was responsible for making me learn C Win32 API programming and
Visual Basic, simply because I loved it so much that I wanted to extend its
capabilities with my own software.

Right now I own 3 of them, only one in working condition, and I guess I should
buy more of them to ensure I always have a working one.


What's your favourite piece of technology right now?
----------------------------------------------------

Right now I can safely say that my favorite pieve of technology is my Sony VAIO
VGN-P11Z [4]. It has always been a dream machine for me ever since I saw one at
a Fnac [5] store in Barcelona while on a family trip in 2009. Looking back it's
obvious that I would love this machine, since it's basically a modern version of
the Jornada 720.

Ever since I finally got mine in January of 2025, after all these years and they
never coming down in price, I have been inserting it more and more into my
workflow, and frequently using it at work for on-site CAD and note taking tasks.


Name one new cool piece of technology we'll have in 25 years!
-------------------------------------------------------------

It's funny that until around 2017 I would be thrilled to answer this question
and would probably have many ideas and wishes, but today I do believe technology
has reached its peak, every day I look more forward to older technologies and
integrating them into my modern way of living, than looking forward to what may
come in the future.

With this in mind, I would say the coolest piece of technology that I wish we
can all have in the future is proper AR glasses, kind of like Google Glass [6],
but with an interface similar to the Apple Vision Pro [7]. Although I know that
whenever that dream materializes it will simply be some depressing tracking
device, fully locked down, and without any soul apart from some gimmicky AI
garbage, just like every piece of technology we have today.


Closing words
-------------

I would like to end this on a hopeful note. Even though the future looks bleak,
technology seems to have reached its peak, and Skynet [8] is right around the
corner, always keep being a curious person, it's what has motivated me
throughout my entire life. Curiosity is what has made humans get to where we are
today. Curiosity is what has made technology possible, and is what should keep
moving you forward, even if it makes you look at technology backwards.

As is the tradition I would like to pass the challenge over to two illustrious
members of the Old Computer Challenge [9] community: Tekk [10] and
unsigned [11].
