	You should admit, creating something new instead of just copying a
	successful scheme is extremely difficult. The guys at
	<a href="http://everything.me/">Everything.Me</a> did the difficult way,
	instead of just copying the Google style, like Bing did, they went to a
	completely new, innovative and useful layout. You can easily tell this by
	how they arranged the results:

<?= compat_image('./everything-me-screenshot.png',
	'Screenshot of the application on my iPhone') ?>

	should go and try it out for yourself. Have fun!
