		<h2>How eBooks Changed My Reading Habits</h2>

<p>
	Before the <a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/">Amazon Kindle</a>, the eBook
	world wasn't very popular, just like the digital music before the iPod
	revolution. I got my hands on a Kindle DX two years ago. I had to order
	my one from eBay since there weren't any international versions of the
	DX, nor I could buy one on Amazon from Brazil. Since then my whole
	reading habits have changed.
</p>

<p>
	I was't a "monthly reader" because it was a bit of a hassle going to a book
	store, finding a good book, buying and going home; this process takes a lot
	of time, and time is something pretty rare these days. But after I got my
	Kindle, everything changed! It was magical! I could go to
	<a href="https://amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>, browse a vast amount of books,
	get recommendations, and, in a single click, they were automatically
	delivered to my Kindle. This killed the old-fashioned way of getting a book
	just by the fact it was simple, fast and comfortable.
</p>

<p>
	Today, we have big companies joining the movement: companies like Apple,
	Barnes and Noble, and Amazon, not to mention the starters: eReader, Iliad,
	Sony... This is making this new market grow in an exponential way. People
	that never had contact with eBook readers started using iBooks on their
	iPads and now love the experience.
</p>

<p>
	I know that this revolution is a big leap forward in the book industry, but
	I see some problems today. Things like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		The price for certain eBooks are almost the same as the paperback
		versions
	</li>
	<li>
		Lack of different languages to choose from. This is so problematic that
		for certain books I go to a store to buy them in my language so I can
		understand it better, since English isn't my mother language
	</li>
	<li>
		Fragmentation: Some eBooks are available in all the major formats (Mobi,
		ePub and PDF), but some aren't and even on the massive Kindle DX screen
		a PDF document isn't the same as a native Mobi eBook
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If the industry figures out how to solve those problems I'm sure that only
	people who really have the need of holding a paper won't get into the eBook
	revolution.
