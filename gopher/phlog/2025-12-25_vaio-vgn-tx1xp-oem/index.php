<pre id="plain-text">Right after OCC 2025 [<a href="gopher://nathancampos.me:70/1/occ/2025">1</a>] and Headcrash's [<a href="http://stuxnode.com/">2</a>] talk about how amazing some of the
older smallish, almost netbook-sized, Sony VAIOs were, I decided that I wanted
to get into some of that fun and play around with one.

I was able to score a VAIO VGN-TX1XP [<a href="https://www.small-laptops.com/sony-vaio-vgn-tx1xp/">3</a>] from 2005 for quite a reasonable price
(~35 EUR) on Wallapop in Spain. It was sadly damaged during shipping, but still
works quite well:

After trying and failing several times to exchange its spinning rust 1.8" IDE
hard drive with an SSD of some kind, as none of my adapters worked and all of
them went unrecognized by the machine's BIOS, I gave up and placed the original
60GB HDD back in its place.

Overall the machine is amazing. It's small in size, the display is extremely
high resolution for its time, at 1366x768 pixels, and its VGP-BPL5 battery [<a href="https://www.amazon.es/dp/B09NQW31QF">4</a>]
is still available and can be purchased for around 25 EUR. I guess its only down
side is the pain in the ass hard drive and BIOS combination.

<h3>Windows XP OEM Files
--------------------</h3>

After all this talk about the machine, let me finally get to the point of this
post. The machine came installed with an almost stock version of Windows XP,
although it had clearly been restored with its factory media, since it had all
of its drivers installed, and most importantly had its OEM information in the
Windows about window.

In a rare moment of intelligence on my part, I decided to make a backup of the
Windows OEM files from system32 (oembios.&ast;, oeminfo.ini, oemlogo.bmp) before
wiping it clean with a brand new Windows XP SP3 CD.

I have uploaded all of them to The Internet Archive [<a href="https://archive.org/details/vaio-vgn-tx1xp-win-oeminfo">5</a>] to ensure that they are
saved forever, but I'm also hosting a mirror that's available both on Gopher [<a href="gopher://nathancampos.me:70/1/phlog/2025-12-25_vaio-vgn-tx1xp-oem/oemfiles">6</a>]
and HTTP [<a href="http://nathancampos.me/log/2025-12-25_vaio-vgn-tx1xp-oem/oemfiles">7</a>] here on my site.
