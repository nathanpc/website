<pre id="plain-text">This will be a short one, but I just want to log this and create yet another
link that can be used to objectively point out that WinSock2 was a mistake.

I love UNIX and POSIX, but there's something about Windows that constantly
attracts me to it. I guess it's a sense of nostalgia, since it was the operating
system that I learned how to compute on, or maybe it's simply a matter of
enjoying painful experiences, I'm not really sure.

Either way, every project that I build, I ensure that it can be compiled/run on
Windows natively, meaning no Cygwin [<a href="https://cygwin.com/">1</a>], and specially I want to compile it with
Microsoft's native tools, meaning Visual C++, since that's the correct way of
doing it, and feels proper, but this comes with a major gotcha: Standards
compatibility.

I don't know if Microsoft wanted to break compatibility with standards on
purpose or not, although given their behaviour in the 90's, it most likely was
on purpose, but their implementation of POSIX and C/C++ standards was a
nightmare. Some of the issues I've encountered when porting applications over
have been logged on my wiki [<a href="https://wiki.nathancampos.me/doku.php?id=devnotes:msvc-porting">2</a>], but this one bit me yet again this week...

I'm currently in the process of rewriting, for the third time, my AirDrop-like
program called GroundLift [<a href="https://github.com/nathanpc/groundlift">3</a>], and in doing so I wanted to port it over to
Windows and get it to compile under Visual Studio.

Porting networking applications over to Windows is a nightmare that no one
should have to endure, and Microsoft has tried to document some of the issues
surrounding this process [<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/porting-socket-applications-to-winsock">4</a>], but at least once a year, I get bitten by the same
bug: Passing a struct timeval as the value to the SO_RCVTIMEO socket option.

In UNIX sockets you have this really nice option for sockets called SO_RCVTIMEO.
It allows you to periodically timeout a recv() call, so that you are able to
shutdown a server cleanly for example. It's a really handy option to use, and
thus is included in almost any piece of networking code that listens for
connections.

Under a sane build environment [<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html">5</a>], this option takes a struct timeval [<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/timeval.3type.html">6</a>] that
represents the time in seconds until socket operations should timeout, but
Microsoft, in all their wisdom, decided that in their implementation of the
sockets API, the SO_RCVTIMEO should take a DWORD with the number of milliseconds
until a timeout occurs [<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-setsockopt">7</a>], and since the setsockopt() function takes a pointer
to a variable for its parameters, it means that if you use a struct timeval as a
sane person, and pass it over to setsockopt(), it will compile without warnings
and the system will simply use the contents of the structure as the timeout
value, which depending on your code, can lead to very nasty bugs where only some
connections timeout, ensuring that you pull your hair out while trying to debug
it.

If you wish for your code to run on both platforms you will have to do something
like this:

<code>struct timeval tv;
#ifdef _WIN32
DWORD dwTimeout;
#endif /* _WIN32 */

/* Set a reception timeout so that we don't block indefinitely. */
tv.tv_sec = 2;
tv.tv_usec = 0;
#ifdef _WIN32
dwTimeout = tv.tv_sec * 1000;
if (setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, (const char*)&amp;dwTimeout,
        sizeof(dwTimeout)) == SOCKET_ERROR) {
    closesocket(sockfd);
    return -1;
}
#else
if (setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, &amp;tv, sizeof(tv)) == -1) {
    close(sockfd);
    return -1;
}
#endif /* _WIN32 */</code>

I guess this is it, I just wanted to rant about Microsoft's awful sockets
implementation. Thanks for wasting your time reading this, I do appreciate it.
