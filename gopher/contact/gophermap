i--- Direct contact -----------------------------------------------------------	header null 0

I'm a really busy person with a lot going on in my life at all times, but it's
totally fair if you want to contact me directly. I will most likely take a
very long time to reply so its fine if you ping me multiple times.

i--- Social media -------------------------------------------------------------	header null 0

I'm not really into social media. I try my best to have a presence in order to
share some of the interesting things that I've been working on, but mostly I
use social media to keep tabs on the industry. Don't expect a lot of content.
