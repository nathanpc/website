			I'm a <b>full-stack developer</b>, <b>creative technologist</b> and
			an <b>electronics engineer</b> born in rainy
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil">Brazil</a> and
			currently living in sunny
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal">Portugal</a>.
			You can find me working on almost anything that involves
			electricity, both in terms of hardware and software.  Building
			things has always been a passion of mine, so you'll notice that I'm
			always self-motivated to work on new projects that involve
			technology. Some of the things that I've worked on have been used
			by hundreds of thousands of people, maybe into the millions
			depending on who's counting, and my work has definitely reached at
			least tens of millions.
		</p>

		<p>I'm currently dedicating some of my time to passing some of my
		knowledge to another generation and having a lot of fun working on
		creative projects with my students and colleagues at
		<a href="https://www.iade.europeia.pt/"> IADE - Creative University</a>.
		I'm mostly involved with the
		<a href="https://www.iade.europeia.pt/en/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-creative-technologies/">
		Creative Technologies</a>,
		<a href="https://www.iade.europeia.pt/en/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-games-development/">
		Games Development</a>, and
		<a href="https://www.iade.europeia.pt/licenciaturas/engenharia-informatica/">
		Computer Engineering</a> degrees. Currently I'm the course coordinator
		of the Computer Engineering degree.</p>

		<p>If you browse this website, <a href="https://github.com/nathanpc">my
		GitHub profile</a>, or <a href="//innoveworkshop.com/"> my company's
		website</a> you'll notice that I'm capable of building quite a lot of
		amazing things. If you're looking for someone with my skillset either
		for your company or to make your idea become a reality feel free to
		reach out to me <a href="mailto:nathan@innoveworkshop.com">via

		<h2>this website</h2>

		<p>As you can clearly notice, this website doesn't look like your
		regular, client-side rendered, Javascript-dependent, bloated, spying,
		and resource hungry webpage that's so prevalent today. I despise the
		way things currently are, the web used to be such a wonderful place and
		currently it's simply depressing. I hate so much how the modern website
		is built that I've decided to build a proper website that adheres to
		the <a href="https://smolweb.org/guidelines.html">smolweb guidelines
		</a>.</p>

		<p>This website was built to showcase that you don't need gigabytes of
		node modules in order to build
		<a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website">a webpage</a>, and most
		importantly, just because <a href="https://web.dev/baseline/">Baseline
		</a> tells you to target the "almost latest and greatest", doesn't mean
		you should. This website is built to be properly rendered on almost any
		web browser, from Lynx to Netscape on Windows 3.11 to the latest version
		of Chrome Canary.</p>

		<p>The main goal behind this website is to bring back
		<a href="https://daniel.industries/2023/10/17/what-happened-to-web-design/">the
		joy of the old web days</a> and allow me to publish more things
		online, something that I felt I was less and less inclined to do given
		our current social media realities. Building this website brought back
		that joy I felt when I first started building webpages, and I hope will
		allow me to keep motivated to continue publishing more of what I'm
		currently up to.</p>

		<p>Another fun aspect about this website is that it's hosted on the
		weirdest and most insane way possible, using hardware and software that
		definitely should not have a public IP on the internet. Did I mention
		the reason for this website to exist is for me to have fun? You can
		learn more about why this website is so slow on its
		<a href="/meta/#why-so-slow">meta page</a>.</p>
